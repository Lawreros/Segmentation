Contained in the `u2net` directory. The citation for the paper is found above, with the official github repository found here: https://github.com/huangmozhilv/u2net_torch. The purpose of this implementation is both to improve my understanding of the use of U^2-nets, as well as provide an alternative learning example/documentation for others reading the source material.
